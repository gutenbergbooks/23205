<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ON TWO PASSAGES IN "ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS
WELL."</h3>

  <p>Among the few passages in Shakspeare upon which little light has been
  thrown, after all that has been written about them, are the following in
  Act. IV. Sc. 2. of <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i>, where Bertram is
  persuading Diana to yield to his desires:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Bert.</i> I pr'ythee, do not strive against my vows:</p>
      <p class="i1">I was compell'd to her; but I love thee</p>
      <p class="i1">By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever</p>
      <p class="i1">Do thee all rights of service.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Dia.</i> Ay, so you serve us,</p>
      <p class="i1">Till we serve you: but when you have our roses,</p>
      <p class="i1">You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,</p>
      <p class="i1">And mock us with our bareness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Bert.</i> How have I sworn?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Dia.</i> 'Tis not the many oaths that make the truth;</p>
      <p class="i1">But the plain single vow, that is vow'd true.</p>
      <p class="i1">What is not holy, that we swear not by,</p>
      <p class="i1">But take the Highest to witness: Then, pray you, tell me,</p>
      <p class="i1">If I should swear by Jove's great attributes,</p>
      <p class="i1">I love'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths,</p>
      <p class="i1">When I did love you ill? this has no holding,</p>
      <p class="i1">To swear by him <i>whom I protest to love</i>,</p>
      <p class="i1">That I will work against him."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Read&mdash;"<i>when</i> I protest to <i>Love</i>."</p>

  <p>It is evident that Diana refers to Bertram's double vows, his marriage
  vow, and the subsequent vow or <i>protest</i> he had made not to keep it.
  "If I should swear by Jove I loved you dearly, would you believe my oath
  when I loved you ill? This has no consistency, to swear by <i>Jove</i>,
  when secretly I protest to <i>Love</i> that I will work against him
  (<i>i.e.</i> against the oath I have taken to Jove)."</p>

  <p>Bertram had <i>sworn by the Highest</i> to love his wife; in his
  letter to his mother he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have wedded her, not bedded her, and sworn to make the <i>not</i>
  eternal:"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>he secretly <i>protests to Love</i> to work against his sacred oath;
  and in his following speech he says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Be not so cruel-holy, Love is holy."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>He had before said:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"&mdash;&mdash;do not strive against my vows:</p>
      <p>I was compell'd to her; but I love thee</p>
      <p>By Love's own sweet constraint:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>clearly indicating that this must be the true sense of the passage. By
  printing <i>when</i> for <i>whom</i>, and <i>Love</i> with a capital
  letter, to indicate the personification, all is made clear. <!-- Page 178
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span></p>

  <p>After further argument from Bertram, Diana answers:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I see that men <i>make ropes in such a scarre</i></p>
      <p>That we'll forsake ourselves."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This Rowe altered to "make <i>hopes</i> in such <i>affairs</i>," and
  Malone to "make <i>hopes</i> in such <i>a scene</i>." Others, and among
  them Mr. Knight and Mr. Collier, retain the old reading, and vainly
  endeavour to give it a meaning, understanding the word <i>scarre</i> to
  signify a <i>rock</i> or <i>cliff</i>, with which it has nothing to do in
  this passage. There can be no doubt that "make <i>ropes</i>" is a
  misprint for "make <i>hopes</i>," which is evidently required by the
  context, "that we'll forsake ourselves." It then only remains to show
  what is meant by <i>a scarre</i>, which signifies here <i>anything that
  causes surprise or alarm</i>; what we should now write <i>a scare</i>.
  Shakspeare has used the same orthography, <i>scarr'd</i>, i.e.
  <i>scared</i>, in <i>Coriolanus</i> and in <i>Winter's Tale</i>. There is
  also abundant evidence that this was its old orthography, indicative of
  the broad sound the word then had, and which it still retains in the
  north. Palsgrave has both the noun and the verb in this form:
  "<i>Scarre</i>, to <i>scar</i> crowes, espouventail." And again, "I
  <i>scarre</i> away or feare away, as a man doth crowes or such like; je
  escarmouche." The French word might lead to the conclusion that <i>a
  scarre</i> might be used for <i>a skirmish</i>. (See Cotgrave in v.
  Escarmouche.) I once thought we should read "in such a <i>warre</i>,"
  <i>i.e.</i> conflict.</p>

  <p>In Minshen's <i>Guide to the Tongues</i>, we have:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To <span class="sc">Scarre</span>, videtur confictum ex <i>sono</i>
  oves vel aliud quid abigentium et terrorem illis incutientium. Gall.
  <i>Ahurir</i> ratione eadem:" vi. <i>to feare, to fright</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Objections have been made to the expression "make hopes;" but the poet
  himself in <i>King Henry VIII.</i> has "more than I dare <i>make
  faults</i>," and repeats the phrase in one of his sonnets: surely there
  is nothing more singular in it than in the common French idiom, "<i>faire
  des esp√©rances</i>."</p>

<h3>GEORGE HERBERT AND THE CHURCH AT LEIGHTON
BROMSWOLD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 85.)</p>

  <p>I have great pleasure in laying before your readers the following
  particulars, which I collected on a journey to Leighton Bromswold,
  undertaken for the purpose of satisfying the Query of E.&nbsp;H. If they will
  turn to <i>A Priest to the Temple</i>, ch. xiii., they will find the
  points to which, with others, my attention was more especially
  directed.</p>

  <p>Leighton Church consists of a western tower, nave, north and south
  porches and transepts, and chancel. There are no aisles. As Prebendary of
  the Prebend of Leighton Ecclesia in Lincoln Cathedral, George Herbert was
  entitled to an estate in the parish, and it was no doubt a portion of the
  increase of this property that he devoted to the repairing and
  beautifying of the House of God, then "lying desolate," and unfit for the
  celebration of divine service. Good Izaak Walton, writing evidently upon
  hearsay information, and not of his own personal knowledge, was in error
  if he supposed, as from his language he appears to have done, that George
  Herbert almost rebuilt the church from the foundation, and he must be
  held to be incorrect in describing that part of it which stood as "so
  decayed, so <i>little</i>, and so useless." There are portions remaining
  earlier than George Herbert's time, whose work may be readily
  distinguished by at least four centuries; whilst at one end the porches,
  and at the other the piscina, of Early English date, the windows, which
  are of different styles, and the buttresses, afford sufficient proofs
  that the existing walls are the original, and that in size the church has
  remained unaltered for ages. As George Herbert new roofed the sacred
  edifice throughout, we may infer this was the chief structural repair
  necessary. He also erected the present tower, the font, put four windows
  in the chancel, and reseated the parts then used by the congregation.</p>

  <p>Except a western organ gallery erected in 1840, two pews underneath
  it, and one elsewhere, these parts, the nave and transepts, remain, in
  all probability, exactly as George Herbert left them. The seats are all
  uniform, of oak, and of the good old open fashion made in the style of
  the seventeenth century. They are so arranged, both in the nave and in
  the transepts, that no person in service time turns his back either upon
  the altar or upon the minister. (See "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>," Vol. ii., p. 397.) The pulpit against the north, and the
  reading-desk, with clerk's seat attached, against the south side of the
  chancel-arch, are both of the same height, and exactly similar in every
  respect; both have sounding-boards. The font is placed at the west end of
  the nave, and, together with its cover, is part of George Herbert's work;
  it stands on a single step, and a drain carries off the water, as in
  ancient examples. The shallowness of the basin surprised me. A vestry,
  corresponding in style to the seats, is formed by a wooden inclosure in
  the south transept, which contains "a strong and decent chest." Until the
  erection of the gallery, the tower was open to the nave.</p>

  <p>The chancel, which is raised one step above the nave, is now partly
  filled with high pews, but, as arranged by the pious prebendary, it is
  believed to have contained only one low bench on either side. The
  communion table, which is elevated by three steps above the level of the
  chancel, is modern, as are also the rails. There is a double Early
  English piscina in the south wall, and an ambry in the north. A plain
  cross of the seventeenth century crowns the eastern gable of the chancel
  externally.</p>

  <p>No doubt there were originally "fit and proper <!-- Page 179 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>texts of scripture
  everywhere painted;" but, if this were so, they are now concealed by the
  whitewash. Such are not uncommon in neighbouring churches. No "poor man's
  box conveniently seated" remains, but there are indications of its having
  been fixed to the back of the bench nearest to the south door.</p>

  <p>The roof is open to the tiles, being, like the seats, Gothic in design
  and of seventeenth century execution. The same may be said of the tower,
  which is battlemented, and finished off with pinnacles surmounted by
  balls, and has a somewhat heavy appearance. But it is solid and
  substantial, and it is evident that no expense was spared to make
  it&mdash;so far as the skill of the time could make it&mdash;worthy of
  its purpose and of the donor. There are five bells. No. 1. has the
  inscription:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span class="scac">IHS NAZARENVS REX IVDEORVM FILI DEI</span></p>
      <p><span class="scac">MISERERE MEI : GEORGE WOOLF VICAR :</span></p>
      <p><span class="scac">I : MICHELL : C : W : W : N. 1720.</span>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Nos. 2. 4. and 5. contain the alphabet in Lombardic capitals; but the
  inscription and date on each of them,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span class="scac">THOMAS NOBBIS MADE ME 1641</span>"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>show that they are not of the antiquity which generally renders the
  few specimens we have of alphabet bells so peculiarly interesting, but
  probably they were copied from the bells in the more ancient tower. No.
  3. has in Lombardic capitals the fragment&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span class="scac">ESME: CCATHERINA,</span>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and is consequently of ante-Reformation date.</p>

  <p>The porches are both of the Early English period, and form therefore a
  very noticeable feature.</p>

  <p>On the external walls are several highly ornamented spouts, upon some
  of which crosses are figured, and upon one with the date "1632" I
  discovered three crests; but as I could not accurately distinguish what
  they were intended to represent, I will not run the risk of describing
  them wrongly. The wivern, the crest of the Herberts, did not appear; nor,
  so far as I could learn, does the fabric itself afford any clue to him
  who was the principal author of its restoration.</p>

  <p>The view from the tower is extensive, and, from the number of spires
  that are visible, very pleasing: fifteen or sixteen village churches are
  to be seen with the naked eye; and I believe that Ely Cathedral, nearly
  thirty miles distant, may be discovered with the aid of a telescope.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Sacramental Wine.</i>&mdash;In a remote hamlet of Surrey I recently
  heard the following superstition. In a very sickly family, of which the
  children were troubled with bad fits, and the poor mother herself is
  almost half-witted, an infant newly born seemed to be in a very weakly
  and unnatural state. One of the gossips from the neighbouring cottages
  coming in, with a mysterious look said, "Sure, the babby wanted
  <i>something</i>,&mdash;a drop of the sacrament wine would do it good."
  On surprise being expressed at such a notion, she added "Oh! they often
  gives it." I do not find any allusion in Brand's <i>Antiquities</i> to
  such popular credence. He mentions the superstition in Berkshire, that a
  ring made from a piece of silver collected at the communion (especially
  that on Easter Sunday) is a cure for convulsions and fits.</p>

  <p>"<i>Snail, Snail, come out of your Hole</i>" (Vol. iii., p.
  132.).&mdash;Your correspondent <span class="sc">S.&nbsp;W. Singer</span> has
  brought to my recollection a verse, which I heard some children singing
  near Exeter, in July last, and noted down, but afterwards forgot to send
  to you:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Snail, snail, shut out your horns;</p>
      <p class="i1">Father and mother are dead:</p>
      <p>Brother and sister are in the back yard,</p>
      <p class="i1">Begging for barley bread."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Geo. E. Frere.</span>

  <p>Perhaps it would not be uninteresting to add to the records of the
  "Snail-charm" (Vol. iii, p. 132.), that in the south of Ireland, also,
  the same charm, with a more fanciful and less threatening burden, was
  used amongst us children to win from its reserve the startled and
  offended snail. We entreated thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Shell a muddy, shell a muddy,</p>
      <p class="i2">Put out your horns,</p>

      <p class="i2">Comings to town</p>
      <p>With a red petticoat and a green gown!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I fear it is impossible to give a clue as to the meaning of the form
  of invocation, or who was the royal visitor, so nationally clothed, for
  whose sake the snail was expected to be so gracious.</p>

  <p><i>Nievie-nick-nack.</i>&mdash;A fire-side game, well known in
  Scotland; described by Jamieson, Chambers, and (last, though not least)
  John M<sup>c</sup>Taggart. The following version differs from that given
  by them:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nievie, nievie, nick, neck,</p>
      <p>Whilk han will thou tak?</p>
      <p>Tak the richt, or tak the wrang,</p>
      <p>I'll beguile thee if I can."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is alluded to by Sir W. Scott, <i>St. Ronan's</i>, iii. 102.;
  <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, August, 1821, p. 37.</p>

  <p>Rabelais mentions <i>√† la nicnoque</i> as one of the games played by
  Guargantua. This is rendered by Urquhart <i>Nivinivinack: Transl.</i>, p.
  94. Jamieson (<i>Supp. to Scot. Dict.</i>, sub voce) adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The first part of the word seems to be from <i>Neive</i>, <!-- Page
  180 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>the fist
  being employed in the game. Shall we view <i>nick</i> as allied to the E.
  <i>v.</i> signifying 'to touch luckily'?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now, there is no such seeming derivation in the first part of the
  word. The <i>Neive</i>, though employed in the game, is not the object
  addressed. It is held out to him who is to guess&mdash;the
  conjuror&mdash;<i>and it is he who is addressed</i>, and under a
  conjuring name. In short (to hazard a wide conjecture, it may be), he is
  invoked in the person of <span class="sc">Nic Neville</span> (<i>Neivie
  Nic</i>), a sorcerer in the days of James VI., who was burnt at St.
  Andrew's in 1569. If I am right, a curious testimony is furnished to his
  quondam popularity among the common people:</p>

<h3>RECORDS AT MALTA.</h3>

  <p>Let me call <i>your</i> attention, as well as that of your readers
  (for good may come from both), to an article in the December No. of the
  <i>Arch√¶ological Journal</i>, 1850, entitled "Notice of Documents
  preserved in the Record Office at Malta;" an article which I feel sure
  ought to be more publicly known, both for the sake of the reading world
  at large, and the high character bestowed upon the present keeper of
  those records, M. Luigi Vella, under whose charge they have been brought
  to a minute course of investigation. There may be found here many things
  worthy of elucidation; many secret treasures, whether for the
  arch√¶ologist, bibliopole, or herald, that only require your widely
  disseminated "brochure" to bring nearer to our own homes and our own
  firesides. It is with this view that I venture to express a hope, that a
  <i>pr√©cis</i> of that article may not be deemed irregular; which point,
  of course, I must leave to your good judgment and good taste to decide,
  being a very Tyro in arch√¶ology, and no book-worm (though I really love a
  book), so I know nothing of <i>their</i> points of etiquette. At the same
  time I must, in justice to Mr. A. Milward (the writer of the notice, and
  to whom I have not the honour of being known), entreat his pardon for the
  plagiarism, if such it can be called, having only the common
  "reciprocation of ideas" at heart; and remain as ever an humble follower
  under Captain Cuttle's standard.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Pr√©cis</span> of <i>Documents preserved in Record Office, Malta</i>.</p>

  <p>Six volumes of Records, parchment, consisting of Charters from

  whose original bull is perfect.</p>

  <p>Two volumes of Papers connected with the Island of Malta before it

  <p>A book of Privileges of the Maltese, compiled about 200 years ago.</p>

  <p>Several volumes of original letters from men of note: among whom we
  may mention, Viceroys of Sicily, Sovereigns of England. One from the
  Pretender, dated 1725, from Rome; three from Charles II., and one from
  his admiral, John Narbrough. Numerous Processes of Nobility, containing
  much of value to many noble families; of these last, Mr. Vella has taken
  the trouble of separating, all those referring to any English
  families.</p>

  <p>Also a volume of fifteenth century, containing the accounts of the
  commanderies. This is a continuation of an older and still more
  interesting volume, which is now in the Public Library.</p>

<h3>ON AN ANCIENT MS. OF "BED√Ü HISTORIA
ECCLESIASTICA."</h3>

  <p>Some gentleman connected with the cathedral library of Lincoln may
  possibly be able to give me some information respecting a MS. copy of the
  <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i> of Beda in my possession, and of which the
  following circumstances are therein apparent:&mdash;It is plainly a MS.
  of great antiquity, on paper, and in folio. On a fly-leaf it has an
  inscription, apparently of contemporaneous date, and which is repeated in
  a more modern hand on the next page with additions, as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hunc librum legavit Will<span class="over">m</span>s Dadyngton
  qu<sup>o</sup>dam Vicarius de Barton sup humbre ecclie Lincoln ut
  e&#x113;t sub custodia Vicecancellarii."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Then follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Script&#x16B; p manus Nic&#x14D;i Belytt Vicecancellarii
  iiii<sup>to</sup> die m&#x113;sis Octob<sup>r</sup> Anno Dni
  milles&#x12B;mo q&#x16B;icentessimo decimoqu&#x12B;to et Lr&#x101;
  d√±icalius G et Anno pp henrici octavi sexto."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the hand of John, father of the more celebrated Ralph Thoresby, is
  added:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nunc e Libris Jo&#x127;is Thoresby de Leedes emp.
  Executor<sup>bus</sup> Tho. D√±i Fairfax, 1673."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Through what hands it may have passed since, I have no means of
  knowing; but it came into mine from Mr. J. Wilson, 19. Great May's
  Buildings, St. Martin's Lane, London, in whose Catalogue for December,
  1831, it appeared, and was purchased by me for 3<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i></p>

  <p>There it is conjectured to be of the twelfth century, and from the
  character there is no reason to doubt that antiquity. It is on paper, and
  has been ill-used. It proceeds no farther than into lib. v. c. xii.,
  otherwise, from the beginning complete. The different public libraries of
  the country abound in MSS. of this book. It is probable <!-- Page 181
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>that, under
  the civil commotions in the reign of Charles I. the MS. in my possession
  came into the hands of General Fairfax, and thence into those of John
  Thoresby: so that no blame can possibly attach to the present, or even
  some past, generations, of the curators of any library, whether cathedral
  or private. It is, at all events, desirable to trace the pedigree of
  existing MSS. of important works, where such information is
  attainable.</p>

  <p>Perhaps some of your correspondents may be able to inform me what
  became of the library of Ralph Thoresby; for into his possession, there
  can be little doubt, it came from his father.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The Potter's and Shepherd's Keepsakes.</i>&mdash;In the cabinet of
  a lover of <i>Folk-lore</i> are two quaint and humble memorials by which
  two "inglorious Miltons" have perpetuated their affection, each in
  characteristic sort. The one was a potter; the other, probably, a
  shepherd. The "pignus amoris" of the former is a small earthenware vessel
  in the shape of a book, intended apparently to hold a "nosegay" of
  flowers. The book has yellow clasps, and is authentically inscribed on
  its sides, thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The. Love. Is. True.</p>
      <p>That. I. owe. You.</p>
      <p>Then. se. you. Bee.</p>
      <p>The. Like. To. Mee.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<i>On the other side.</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The. Gift. Is. Small.</p>
      <p>Good. will. Is. all.</p>

      <p class="i3">1688."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The shepherd's love gift is a wooden implement, very neatly carved,
  and intended to hold knitting-needles. On the front it has this
  couplet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="scac">"WHEN THIS YOV SEE.</span></p>
      <p><span class="scac">REMEMBER MEE. MW.</span></p>

  </div>
  <p>To an uninformed mind these sincere records of honest men seem as much
  "signs of the times" as the perfumed sonnets dropped by expiring swains
  into the vases of "my lady Betty," and "my lady Bab," with a view to
  publication.</p>

  <p class="author">H. G. T.

  <p><i>Writing-paper.</i>&mdash;I have long been subject to what, in my
  case, I feel to be a serious annoyance. For the last twenty years I have
  been unable to purchase any letter-paper which I can write upon with
  comfort and satisfaction. At first, I was allowed to choose between plain
  and hot-pressed; but now I find it impossible to meet with any, which is
  not glazed or smeared over with some greasy coating, which renders it
  very disagreeable for use with a common quill&mdash;and I cannot endure a
  steel pen. My style of writing, which is a strong round Roman hand, is
  only suited for a quill.</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents put me in the way of procuring the good
  honest letter-paper which I want? I have in vain applied to the
  stationers in every town within my reach. Would any of the paper-mills be
  disposed to furnish me with a ream or two of the unglazed, plain, and
  unhotpressed paper which I am anxious to obtain?</p>

  <p>Whilst I am on this subject, I will take occasion to lament the very
  great inferiority of the paper generally which is employed in printing
  books. It may have a fine, glossy, smooth appearance, but its texture is
  so poor and flimsy, that it soon frays or breaks, without the greatest
  care; and many an immortal work is committed to a miserably frail and
  perishable material!</p>

  <p>A comparison of the books which were printed a century ago, with those
  of the present day, will, I conceive, fully establish the complaint which
  I venture to make; and I would particularly remark upon the large Bibles
  and Prayer Books which are now printed at the Universities for the use of
  our churches and chapels, which are exposed to much wear and tear, and
  ought, therefore, to be of more substantial and enduring texture, but are
  of so flimsy, brittle, and cottony a manufacture, that they require
  renewing every three or four years.</p>

  <p><i>Little Casterton (Rutland) Church.</i>&mdash;Within the communion
  rails in the church of Little Casterton, Rutland, there lies in the
  pavement (or did lately) a stone, hollowed out like the basin or drain of
  a piscina, which some church-hunters have supposed to be a piscina, and
  have noticed as a great singularity. The stone, however, did not
  originally belong to this church; it was brought from the neighbouring
  site of the desecrated church of Pickworth, by the late Reverend Richard
  Twopeny, who held the rectory of Little Casterton upwards of sixty years;
  he had long seen it lying neglected among the ruins, and at length
  brought it to his own church to save it from destruction.</p>

  <p>It may be interesting to some of your readers to learn that in the
  chancel of Little Casterton are monumental brasses of an armed male and a
  female figure, the latter on the sinister side, with the following
  inscription in black letter:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>St. Clare.</i>&mdash;In the interesting and amusing volume of

  church of St. Cleer in Cornwall, with its Well and ruined Oratory, to St.
  Clare, the heroic Virgin of Assisi; but in the elegant and useful
  <i>Calendar of the Anglican Church</i>, the same church is ascribed to
  St. Clair, the Martyr of Rouen. My own impression is, that the latter is
  correct; but I note the circumstance, that some of your readers better
  informed than myself, may be enabled to answer the Query, which is the
  right ascription? When Mr. Collins alluded to the fate of Bishop Hippo,
  devoured by rats, I presume he means Bishop Hatto, commemorated in the

  circa temp. Hen. VIII., of the arms of "Doctor Willm. Haryngton,

  pendant on each side: these appendages, however, are somewhat different

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. iii., p. 139.)</p>

  <p>(43.) Is there any valid reason for not dating the publication of some
  of Gerson's treatises at Cologne earlier than the year 1470? and if good
  cause cannot be shown for withholding from them so high a rank in the
  scale of typographic being, must we not instantly reject every effort to
  extenuate Marchand's obtuseness in asserting with reference to Ulric
  Zell, "On ne voit des √©ditions de ce Zell qu'en 1494?" (<i>Hist. de
  l'Imp.</i>, p. 56.) <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span>Schelhorn's opinion as to the birthright
  of these tracts is sufficient to awaken an interest concerning them, for
  he conceived that they should be classed among the earliest works
  executed with cut moveable characters. (<i>Diat. ad Card. Quirini
  lib.</i>, p. 25. Cf. Seemiller, i. 105.) So far as I can judge, an
  adequate measure of seniority has not been generally assigned to these
  Zellian specimens of printing, if it be granted "Coloniam Agrippinam post
  Moguntinenses prim√πm recepisse artem." (Meerman, ii. 106.) This writer's
  representation, in his ninth plate, of the type used in 1467, supplies us
  with ground for a complete conviction that these undated Gersonian
  manuals are at least as old as the <i>Augustinus de singularitate
  clericorum</i>. But why are they not older? Is there any document which
  has a stronger conjectural claim? Van de Velde's <i>Catalogue</i>, tome
  i. Gand, 1831, contains notices of some of them; and one volume before me
  has the first initial letter principally in blue and gold, the rest in
  red, and all elaborated with a pen. The most unevenly printed, and
  therefore, I suppose, the primitial gem, is the <i>Tractatus de
  mendicitate spirituali</i>, in which not only rubiform capitals, but
  whole words, have been inserted by a chirographer. It is, says Van de
  Velde, (the former possessor,) on the fly-leaf, "sans chiffres et
  r√©clames, en longues lignes de 27 lignes sur les pages enti√®res." The
  full stop employed is a sort of twofold, recumbent, circumflex or caret;
  and the most eminent watermark in the paper is a Unicorn, bearing a much
  more suitable antelopian weapon than is that awkwardly horizontal horn
  prefixed by Dr. Dibdin to the Oryx in profile which he has depicted in
  plate vi. appertaining to his life of Caxton: <i>Typographical
  Antiquities</i>, vol. i.</p>

  <p>(44.) Wherein do the ordinary <i>Hymni et Sequenti√¶</i> differ from
  those according to the use of Sarum? Whose is the oldest <i>Expositio</i>
  commonly attached to both? and respecting it did Badius, in 1502,
  accomplish much beyond a revision and an amendment of the style? Was not
  Pynson, in 1497, the printer of the folio edition of the Hymns and
  Sequences entered in Mr. Dickinson's valuable <i>List of English
  Service-Books</i>, p. 8.; or is there inaccuracy in the succeeding line?
  Lastly, was the titular woodcut in Julian Notary's impression, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1504 (Dibdin, ii. 580.), derived from the
  decoration of the <i>Hymnarius</i>, and the <i>Textus Sequentiarum cum
  optimo commento</i>, set forth at Delft by Christian Snellaert, in 1496?
  From the first page of the latter we receive the following accession to
  our philological knowledge:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Diabolus dicitur a <i>dia</i>, quod est duo, et <i>bolos</i> morsus;
  quasi dupliciter mordens; quia l√¶dit hominem in corpore et anima."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>(45.) (1.) In what edition of the Salisbury Missal did the amusing
  errors in the "Ordo Sponsalium" first occur; and how long were they
  continued? I allude to the husband's obligation, "to haue and to holde
  fro thys day <i>wafor beter</i> for wurs," &amp;c., and to the wife's
  prudential promise, "to haue et to holde <i>for thys day</i>." (2.) Are
  there any vellum leaves in any copy in England of the folio impression
  very beautifully printed <i>en rouge et noir</i> "in alma Parisiorum
  academia," die x. Kal. April, 1510?</p>

  <p>(46.) On the 11th of last month (Jan.) somebody advertised in "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" for <i>Foxes and Firebrands</i>. In
  these days of trouble and rebuke, when (if we may judge from a recent
  article savouring of Neal's second volume) it seems to be expected that
  English gentlemen will, in a Magazine that bears their name, be pleased
  with a r√©chauff√© of democratic obloquy upon the character of the great
  reformer of their church, and will look with favour upon <i>Canterburies
  Doome</i>, would it not be desirable that Robert Ware's (and Nalson's)
  curious and important work should be republished? If a reprint of it were
  to be undertaken, I would direct attention to a copy in my possession of
  "The Third and Last Part," Lond. 1689, which has many alterations marked
  in MS. for a new edition, and which exhibits the autograph of Henry
  Ware.</p>

  <p>(47.) Was <span class="sc">Cohausen</span> the composer of "Clericus
  Deperrucatus; sive, in fictitiis Clericorum Comis moderni seculi ostensa
  et explosa Vanitas: Cum Figuris: Autore <span class="sc">Ann&oelig;o
  Rhisenno Vecchio</span>, Doctore Romano-Catholico," printed at Amsterdam,
  and inscribed to Pope Benedict XIII.? One of the well-finished
  copperplates, page 12., represents "<i>Monsieur l'Abb√© prenant du
  Tabac</i>."</p>

  <p>(48.) Where can a copy of the earliest edition of the <i>Testamentum
  XII. Patriarcharum</i> be found? for if one had been easily obtainable,
  Grabe, Cave, Oudin, and Wharton (<i>Ang. Sac.</i> ii. 345.) would not
  have treated the third impression as the first; and let it be noted by
  the way that "Clerico <i>Elichero</i>" in Wharton must be a mistake for
  "Clerico <i>Nicolao</i>." Moreover, how did the excellent Fabricius
  (<i>Bibl. med. et inf. Latin.</i>, and also <i>Cod. Pseudepig. V.&nbsp;T.</i>,
  i. 758.) happen to connect Menradus Moltherus with the <i>editio
  princeps</i> of 1483? It is certain that this writer's letter to
  Secerius, accompanying a transcript of Bishop Grosset√™te's version, which
  immediately came forth at Haguenau, was concluded "postridie Non. Januar.
  <span class="scac">M.D.XXXII.</span>"</p>

  <p>(49.) (1.) Who was the bibliopolist with whom originated the
  pernicious scheme of adapting newly printed title-pages to books which
  had had a previous existence? Sometimes the deception may be discerned
  even at a glance: for example, without the loss of many seconds, and by
  the aspect of a single letter, (the long s,) we can perceive the
  falsehood of the imprint, "Parisiis, apud Paul Mellier, 1842," together
  with "S.-Clodoaldi, √® typographeo Belin-Mandar," grafted upon tome i.
  <!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page184"></a>{184}</span>of the Benedictine edition of S. Gregory
  Nazianzen's works, which had been actually issued in 1778. Very
  frequently, however, the comparison of professedly different impressions
  requires, before they can be safely pronounced to be identical, the
  protracted scrutiny of a practised eye. An inattentive observer could not
  be conscious that the works of Sir James Ware, translated and improved by
  Harris, and apparently the progeny of the year 1764, (the only edition,
  and that but a spurious one, recorded in Watt's <i>Bibliotheca
  Britannica</i>,) have been skilfully tampered with, and should be justly
  restored&mdash;the first volume to 1739, the second to 1745.</p>

  <p>(2.) We must admit that a bookseller gifted with mature sapience will
  very rarely, or never, be such an amateur in expensive methods of
  bamboozling, as to prefer having recourse to the title-page expedient, if
  he could flatter himself that his purpose would be likely to be effected
  simply by <i>doctoring the date</i>; and thus a question springs up, akin
  to the former one, How great is the antiquity of this timeserving device?
  At this moment, trusting only to memory, I am not able to adduce an
  instance of the depravation anterior to the year 1606, when Dr. James's
  <i>Bellum Papale</i> was put forth in London as a new book, though in
  reality there was no novelty connected with it, except that the last 0 in
  1600 (the authentic date) had been compelled by penmanship to cease to be
  a dead letter, and to germinate into a 6.</p>

  <p>(3.) If neither the judicious naturalisation of a title-page, nor the
  dexterous corruption of the year in which a work was honestly produced,
  should avail to eliminate "the stock in hand," <i>res ad Triarios
  rediit</i>&mdash;there is but one contrivance left. This is, to give to
  the ill-fated hoard <i>another name</i>; in the hope that a proverb
  properly belonging to a rose may be superabundantly verified in the case
  of an old book. What Anglo-Saxon scholar has not studied "<i>Divers
  Ancient Monuments</i>," revived in 1638? and yet perhaps scarcely any one
  is aware that the appellation is entirely deceptive, and that no such
  collection was printed at that period. The inestimable remains of √Ülfric,
  edited by L'Isle in 1623, and then entitled, "<i>A Saxon Treatise
  concerning the Old and New Testament</i>," together with a reprint of the
  "<i>Testimonie of Antiquitie</i>," (sanctioned by Archbishop Parker in
  1567,) had merely submitted to substitutes for the first two leaves with
  which they had been ushered into the world, and after fifteen years the
  unsuspecting public were beguiled. When was this system of misnomers
  introduced? and can a more signal specimen of this kind of shamelessness
  be mentioned than that which is afforded by the fate of Thorndike's <i>De
  ratione ac jure finiendi Controversias Ecclesi√¶ Disputatio</i>? So this
  small folio in fours was designated when it was published, Lond. 1670;
  but in 1674 it became <i>Origines</i> <i>Ecclesiastic√¶</i>; and it was
  metamorphosed into <i>Restauratio Ecclesi√¶</i> in 1677.</p>

  <p>(50.) Dr. Dibdin (<i>Typ. Antiq.</i> iii. 350.) has thus spoken of a
  quarto treatise, <i>De autoritate, officio, et potestate Pastorum
  ecclesiasticorum</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This very scarce book is anonymous, and has neither date, printer's
  name, nor place; but being bound up with two other tracts of Berthelet's
  printing <i>are my reasons</i> for giving it a place here."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The argument and the language in this sentence are pretty nearly on a
  par; for as misery makes men acquainted with dissimilar companions, why
  may not parsimony conglutinate heterogeneous compositions? I venture to
  deny altogether that the engraved border on the title-page was executed
  by an English artist. It seems rather to be an original imitation of
  Holbein's design: and as regards the date, can we not perceive what was
  meant for a modest "1530" on a standard borne by one of the boys in
  procession? In Simler's Gesnerian <i>Bibliotheca</i> <span
  class="sc">Simon Hess</span> (let me reiterate the question, Who was he?)
  is registered as the author; and of his work we read, "Liber impressus in
  Germania." This observation will determine its locality to a certain
  extent; and the tractate may be instantly distinguished from all others
  on the same subject by the presence of the following alliterative
  frontispiece:&mdash;</p>

<h3>ENIGMATICAL EPITAPH.</h3>

  <p>In the church of Middleton Tyas, in the North Riding of the county,
  there is the following extraordinary inscription on the monument of a
  learned incumbent of that parish:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This Monument rescues from oblivion the Remains of the Rev. John
  Mawer, D.D., late Vicar of this Parish, who died Nov. 18th, 1763, aged
  60. The doctor was descended from the royal family of Mawer, and was
  inferior to none of his illustrious ancestors in personal merit, being
  the greatest linguist this nation ever produced. He was able to write and
  speak twenty-two languages, and particularly excelled in the Eastern
  tongues, in which he proposed to his Royal Highness Frederick Prince of
  Wales, to whom he was firmly attached, to propagate the Christian
  religion in the Abyssinian empire,&mdash;a great and noble design, which
  was frustrated by the death of that amiable prince."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whitaker, after giving the epitaph verbatim in his <i>History of
  Richmondshire</i>, vol. i. p. 234., says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This extraordinary personage, who may seem to have been qualified for
  the office of universal interpreter to all the nations upon earth,
  appears, <!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page185"></a>{185}</span>notwithstanding, to have been unaware that
  the Christian religion, in however degraded a form, has long been
  professed in Abyssinia. With respect to the royal line of Mawer I was
  long distressed, till, by great good fortune, I discovered that it was no
  other than that of old King Coyl."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As I happen to feel an interest in the subject which disinclines me to
  rest satisfied with the foregoing hasty&mdash;not to say flippant
  explanation of the learned historian, I am anxious to inquire whether or
  not any reader of the "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" can
  throw light on the history, and especially the genealogy, of this worthy
  and amiable divine? While I have reason to believe that Dr. Mawer was
  about the last person in the world to have composed the foregoing eulogy
  on his own character, I cannot believe that the allusion to illustrious
  ancestors "is merely a joke," as Whitaker seems to imply; while it is
  quite certain that there is nothing in the inscription to justify the
  inference that the deceased had been "unaware that the Christian
  religion" had "long been professed in Abyssinia:" indeed, an inference
  quite the reverse would be quite as legitimate.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S "MERCHANT OF VENICE"</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Act IV. Sc. 1.).</p>

  <p>In the lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The quality of Mercy is not strained,</p>
      <p>It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven,</p>
      <p>Upon the place beneath."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>What is the meaning of the word "strained?" The verb <i>to strain</i>
  is susceptible of two essentially different interpretations; and the
  question is as to which of the two is here intended? On referring to
  Johnson's Dictionary, we find, amongst other synonymous terms, <i>To
  squeeze through something; to purify by filtration; to weaken by too much
  violence; to push to its utmost strength</i>. Now, if we substitute
  either of the two latter meanings, we shall have an assertion that "Mercy
  is not weakened by too much violence (or put to its utmost strength), but
  droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven," &amp;c., where it would
  require a most discerning editor to explain the connexion between the two
  clauses. If, on the other hand, we take the first two meanings, the
  passage is capable of being understood, if nothing else. Beginning with
  <i>to squeeze through something</i>; what would present itself to our
  ideas would be, that "Mercy does not fall in one continuous stream (as
  would be the case, if <i>strained</i>) on one particular portion of the
  earth, but expands into a large and universal shower, so as to spread its
  influence over the entire globe." This, however, though not absurd, is, I
  fear, rather forced.</p>

  <p>To come to the second explanation of <i>to purify</i>, which in my
  opinion is the most apt, I take it that Shakspeare intended to say, that
  "Mercy is so pure and undefiled as to require no cleansing, but falls as
  gently and unsullied as the showers from heaven, ere soiled by the
  impurities of earth."</p>

  <p>With these few remarks, I shall leave the matter in the hands of those
  whose researches into the English language may have been deeper than my
  own, with a hope that they may possess time and inclination to promote
  the elucidation of a difficulty in one of the most beautiful passages of
  our great national bard; a difficulty, by the way, which seems to have
  escaped the notice of all the editors and commentators.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Was Lord Howard of Effingham, who commanded in chief against the
  Spanish Armada, a Protestant or a Papist?</i>&mdash;On the one hand, it
  is highly improbable that Queen Elizabeth should employ a popish
  commander against the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>1. The silence of Dr. Lingard and other historians is also negatively
  in favour of his being a Protestant.</p>

  <p>But, on the other hand, it has been repeatedly asserted, in both
  houses of Parliament, that he was a Papist.</p>

  <p>2. It is <i>likely</i>, because his <i>father</i> was the eldest son
  by his second wife of Thomas, second Duke of Norfolk, and was created
  Baron Howard of Effingham by Queen Mary.</p>

  <p>3. Whatever his own religion may have been, he was contemporary with
  his cousin, Philip, Earl of Arundel, whom Camden calls the champion of
  the Catholics, and whose <i>violence</i> was the cause of his perpetual
  imprisonment.</p>

  <p>4. The present Lord Effingham has recently declared that by blood he
  was (had always been?) connected with the Roman Catholics.</p>

  <p>Under these and <i>other</i> circumstances, it is a question to be
  settled by <i>evidence</i>.</p>

  there to have died. I should be very glad of further particulars of these
  persons. Are my dates correct? How is this branch of the family (lately
  represented by John Joseph Peyton, Esq., of Wakehurst, who married a
  daughter of Sir East Clayton East, Bart., and died in 1844, leaving four
  children minors) connected with the Baronets Peyton, of Iselham, or
  Dodington? Who was the father of the above Commodore? It may aid the

  <p><i>Haybands in Seals.</i>&mdash;I have, in a small collection of
  Sussex deeds, two which present the following peculiarity: they have the
  usual slip of parchment and lump of wax pendant from the lower edge, but
  the wax, instead of bearing an armorial figure, a merchant's mark, or any
  other of the numerous devices formerly employed in the authentication of
  deeds instead of one's chirograph, has neatly inserted into it a small
  wreath composed of two or three stalks of grass (or rather hay) carefully
  plaited, and forming a circle somewhat less in diameter than a shilling.
  The deeds, which were executed in the time of Henry the Seventh, relate
  to the transfer of small landed properties. I have no doubt that this
  diminutive <i>hayband</i> was the distinctive mark of a grazier or
  husbandman who did not consider his social status sufficient to warrant
  the use of a more regular device by way of seal. I have seen a few others
  connected with the same county, and, if I recollect rightly, of a
  somewhat earlier date. I shall be glad to ascertain whether this curious
  practice was in use in other parts of England.</p>

  the reign of Richard II., and which were so long in the toes that it was
  necessary to tie them with chains to the knee, in order to render it
  possible for the wearer to walk. Stowe, in his <i>Chronicle</i>, tells us
  that this extravagant fashion was brought in by Anne of Bohemia, Queen of
  Richard II. But why were they called <i>Cracowe</i> pikes?</p>

<h3>CRANMER'S DESCENDANTS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 8.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent may be interested to know, that Sir Anthony
  Chester, Bart., of Chichley, co. Bucks, married, May 21, 1657, Mary, dau.
  of Samuel Cranmer, Esq., alderman of London, and sister to Sir C√¶sar
  Cranmer, Kt., of Ashwell, Bucks. This Samuel Cranmer was traditionally
  the last male heir of the eldest of Cranmer's sons; his descent is, I
  believe, stated in general terms in the epitaphs of Lady Chester, at
  Chichley, and Sir C√¶sar Cranmer, at Ashwell. He was a great London brewer
  by trade, and married his cousin Mary (sister of Thomas Wood, Bishop of
  Coventry and Lichfield, and Sir Henry Wood, Bart., of the Board of Green
  Cloth), dau. of Thomas Wood, Esq., of Hackney, by his wife &mdash;&mdash;
  Cranmer. They had only two children, and it would appear from Harleian
  MS. No. 1476. fo. 419., which omits all mention of Sir C√¶sar, that he
  died in his father's lifetime, and that Lady Chester was sole heiress to
  this branch of the Cranmers.</p>

  <p>There are two brief pedigrees I have seen of these Cranmers, one in
  Harl. MS. 1476. above <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>mentioned, the other in Philipot's
  <i>Catalogue of Knights</i>; but neither of them goes so far as to
  connect them with the archbishop, or even with the Nottinghamshire
  family; for they both begin with Samuel Cranmer's grandfather, who is
  described of Alcester, co. Warwick. Now the connexion is certain: could
  one of your readers supply me with the wanting links? Is it possible that
  they omit all mention of the archbishop on account of the prejudice
  mentioned by your correspondent; being able to supply the three
  generations necessary to gentility without him?</p>

  <p>I am obliged to write without any books of reference, or I would have
  consulted the epitaphs in question again.</p>

  <p class="author">R. E. W.

  <p>I am afraid that my quotations from memory, in my letter of Saturday,
  were <i>not exactly correct</i>; for on examining Lipscomb's
  <i>Buckinghamshire</i> to-day, I find that it is stated (vol. iv. pp.
  4-7.) on the monument of Samuel Cranmer at <i>Astwood Bury</i>, that he
  was "descended in a direct line from Richard Cranmer, elder brother to
  Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury;" and that it was found, on an
  inquisition held on April 7, 1640, that his son and heir C√¶sar Cranmer
  (called on the monument "Sir C√¶sar Wood At<sup>e</sup> Cranmer, Kt.") was
  his heir at six years of age. This C√¶sar was knighted by Charles II., and
  died unmarried; so that his sister, Lady Chester, was evidently the
  representative of this branch of the Cranmer family.</p>

  <p>Now, with regard to this statement on the monument, in the first place
  it is discrepant with Lady Chester's epitaph at Chichley, which
  (Lipscomb's <i>Bucks</i>, vol. iv. p. 97.) expressly declares that she
  derived her descent from the archbishop. In the next place it appears
  from Thoroton's <i>Notts</i>, that the archbishop had no elder brother
  named Richard. His elder brother's name was John; who by Joan, dau. of
  John Frechevill, Esq., had two sons, Thomas and <i>Richard</i>. Could
  this be the Richard alluded to? In the third place, in neither of the
  pedigrees alluded to is there given any connexion with the family of
  Cranmer of Aslacton. And, lastly, it is opposed to the uniform tradition
  of the family. Now, if any of your readers can clear up this difficulty,
  or will refer me to any other pedigree of the Cranmers, I shall feel
  extremely obliged to him.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the points now noticed, my former letter was
  perfectly correct, and may be relied on in every respect.</p>

  <p>I may mention that these Cranmers were from Warwickshire. The monument
  states that Samuel Cranmer was born at "Aulcester" in that county, "about
  the year 1575."</p>

<h3>BARONS OF HUGH LUPUS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 87.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent P. asks for information respecting the families and
  descendants of William Malbank and Bigod de Loges, two of the Barons of
  Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, whose signatures are affixed to the charter
  of foundation of St. Werburgh's Abbey at Chester.</p>

  <p>Of the descendants of William Malbank I can learn nothing; but it
  appears from the MS. catalogue of the Norman nobility before the
  Conquest, that Roger and Robert de Loges possessed lordships in the
  district of Coutances in Normandy. One at least, Roger, must have
  accompanied the Conqueror to England (and his name appears in the roll of
  Battle Abbey as given by Fox), for we find that he held lands in Horley
  and Burstowe in Surrey. His widow, Gunuld de Loges, held the manor of
  Guiting in Gloucestershire of King William; and in the year 1090 she gave
  two hides of land to the monastery of Gloucester to pray for the soul of
  her husband. Roger had two sons, Roger and Bigod, or, as he is sometimes
  called, Robert. The former inherited the lands in Surrey. One of his
  descendants (probably his great-grandson) was high sheriff of Surrey and
  Sussex in the years 1267, 1268, and 1269. His son Roger de Loges owned
  lands and tenements in Horley, called La Bokland, which he sold to the
  Abbot of <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span>Chertsea. His successor, John de Logge of
  Burstowe, witnessed in the tenth year of Edward II. a deed relating to
  the transfer of land in Hadresham, Surrey. The name became gradually
  corrupted to Lodge.</p>

  <p>To return to the subject of inquiry, Bigod de Loges&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"held five tenements in Sow of the Earl of Chester, by the service of
  conducting the said earl towards the king's court through the midst of
  the forest of Cannock, meeting him at Rotford bridge upon his coming, and
  at Hopwas bridge on his return. In which forest the earl might, if he
  pleased, kill a deer at his coming, and another at his going back: giving
  unto Loges each time he should so attend him a barbed arrow. Hugo de
  Loges granted to William Bagot all his lands in Sow, to hold of him the
  said Hugo and his heirs, by the payment of a pair of white gloves at the
  feast of St. Michael yearly."&mdash;Dugdale.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Bigod de Loges had two sons, Hugo and Odardus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Odardus de Loges was infeoffed by Ranulphus de Meschines, Earl of
  Chester, in the baronies of Stanyton, Wigton, Doudryt, Waverton,
  Blencoyd, and Kirkbride, in the county of Cumberland; and the said
  Odardus built Wigton church and endowed it. He lived until King John's
  time. Henry I. confirmed the grant of the barony to him, by which it is
  probable that he lived a hundred years. He had issue Adam. Adam had issue
  Odard, the lord, whose son and heir, Adam the Second, died without issue,
  and Odard the Fourth likewise," &amp;c.&mdash;Denton's <i>MS.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of the branch settled in Staffordshire and Warwickshire&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hugo de Loges married, tempo Richard I., Margerie, daughter and
  heiress of Robert de Brok. By this marriage Hugo became possessed of the
  manor of Casterton in Warwickshire. He was forester of Cannock chace. He
  had issue Hugo de Loges, of Chesterton, whose son and heir, Sir Richard
  de Loges, died 21st of Edward I. Sir Richard had issue two sons, Richard
  and Hugo. The eldest, Richard of Chesterton, left issue an only daughter,
  Elizabeth, married to Nicholas de Warwick. The issue of this marriage was
  John de Warwick, whose daughter and heiress, Eleonora, married Sir John
  de Peto, and brought the manor of Chesterton into that
  family."&mdash;Dugdale.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S "ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 139.)</p>

  <p>The scene in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> contains two expressions
  which are in <i>Henry VIII.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"Learn this, Silius."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"Learn this, brother."&mdash;<i>Hen. VIII.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"The Captain's captain."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"To be her Mistress' mistress, the Queen's queen."&mdash;<i>Hen. VIII.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The first of these passages is in a scene in <i>Henry VIII.</i>, which
  <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> gives to Fletcher (and of which,
  by-the-bye, it may be observed, that, like the scene in <i>Antony and
  Cleopatra</i>, it has nothing to do with the business of the play). The
  other is in a scene which he gives to Shakspeare.</p>

  <p>But, perhaps, there may be doubts whether rightly. I am exceedingly
  ignorant in Fletcher; but here is a form of expression which occurs twice
  in the scene, which, I believe, is more conformable to the practice of
  Fletcher:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>A</i> heed was in his countenance."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"And force them with <i>a</i> constancy."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There is very great stiffness in the versification: one instance is
  quite extraordinary:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"Yet I know her for</p>
      <p>A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to</p>
      <p>Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of</p>
      <p>Our hard rul'd king."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There is great stiffness and tameness in the matter in many
  places.</p>

  <p>Lastly, what <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> hopes he has taken
  off Shakspeare's shoulders, the compliments to the Queen and the King, is
  brought in here most forcedly:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"She (<i>i.e.</i> A. Boleyn) is a gallant creature, and complete</p>
      <p>In mind and feature. I persuade me, from her</p>
      <p>Will fall some blessings to this land, which shall</p>
      <p>In it be memoriz'd."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But there is also the general question, whether, either upon <i>√†
  priori</i> probability, or inferences derived from particular passages,
  we are bound to suppose that the two authors wrote scene by scene.
  Shakspeare might surely be allowed to touch up scenes, of which the mass
  might be written by Fletcher.</p>

  <p>As to the dates, <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> is persuaded that
  <i>Henry VIII.</i> was written in the winter of 1603-4. The accession of
  James was in March, 1603. <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> thinks that
  the compliments to Queen Elizabeth were not written in her lifetime. He
  thinks that, even in the last year of her long reign, no one would have
  ventured to call her an "aged princess," though merely as a way of saying
  that she would have a long reign; and he says, there is not the slightest
  evidence that the compliment to King James was an interpolation. But
  surely it is strong evidence that if there is no interpolation, this
  passage&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"As when</p>
      <p>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden ph&oelig;nix,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>afterwards&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When Heav'n shall call her from this cloud of darkness,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and then, after disposing of the King&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"She shall be to the happiness of England</p>
      <p>An aged princess &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>
      <p>Would I had known no more&mdash;but she must die;</p>
      <p>She must&mdash;the saints must have her yet a virgin," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span></p>

  <p>would be ridiculous. All that can be said is, that either way it is
  partly ridiculous to make it a matter of prophecy and lamentation that a
  human being must, sometime or other, die.</p>

  <p>But it is very difficult to conceive that the compliments to Elizabeth

  <p>Fletcher, born in 1579, did not, in Mr. Dyce's opinion, bring out
  anything singly or jointly with Beaumont till 1606 or 1607.</p>

  <p>The irrelevant scenes, like that of Ventidius, are introduced with two
  objects&mdash;one to gain time, the other for the sake of naturalness: of
  the latter of which there are two instances in <i>Macbeth</i>; one where
  the King talks of the swallows' nests: the other, relating to the English
  king touching for the evil, seems remarkably suited to the mind of
  Shakspeare.</p>

<h3>"SUN, STAND THOU STILL UPON GIBEON!"</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<span class="scac">JOSH.</span> x. 12.)</p>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 137.)</p>

  <p>The observations of I. K. upon this passage have obviously proceeded
  from a praiseworthy wish to remove what has appeared to some minds to be
  inconsistent with that perfect truth which they expect to be the result
  of divine inspiration. I.&nbsp;K. doubtless believes that God put it into the
  heart of Joshua to utter a command for the miraculous continuance of
  daylight. But why should he expect the inspiration to extend so far as to
  instruct Joshua respecting the manner in which that continuance was to be
  brought about? Joshua was not to be the worker of the miracle. It was to
  be wrought by Him who can as easily stop any part of the stupendous
  machinery of His universe, as we can stop the wheels of a watch. Joshua
  was left to speak, as he naturally would, in terms well fitted to make
  those around him understand, and tell others, that the sun and moon, whom
  the defeated people notoriously worshipped, were so far from being able
  to protect their worshippers, that they were made to promote their
  destruction at the bidding of Joshua, whom God had commissioned to be the
  scourge of idolaters. And when the inspired recorder of the miracle wrote
  that "the sun stood still," he told what the eyes saw, with the same
  truth as I might say that the sun <i>rose</i> before seven this morning.
  Inspiration was not bestowed to make men wise in astronomy, but wise unto
  salvation.</p>

  <p>Those who think that the inspired penman should have said "the earth
  stood still," in order to give a perfectly true account of the miracle,
  have need to be told, or would do well to remember, that the stopping of
  the diurnal revolution of the earth, in order to keep the sun and moon's
  apparent places the same, would not involve a cessation of its motion in
  its orbit, still less a cessation of that great movement of the whole
  solar system, by which it is now more than conjectured that the sun, the
  moon, and the earth are all carried on together at the rate of above 3700
  miles in an hour; so that to say "the earth stood still" would be liable
  to the same objection, viz., that of not being astronomically true. I.&nbsp;K.
  carries his notion of the "inseparable connexion" of the sun "with all
  planetary motion" too far, when he supposes that a stoppage of the sun's
  motion round its own axis would have any effect on our planet. The note
  he quotes from Kitto's <i>Pictorial Bible</i> is anything but
  satisfactory; and that from Mant is childishly common-place. Good old
  Scott adverts with propriety to the Creator's power to keep all things in
  their places, when the earth's revolution was stopped; but when he
  endeavoured to illustrate it by the little effect of a ship's <i>casting
  anchor when under full sail</i>, he should have consulted his friend
  Newton, who would have stopped such an imagination. Another commentator,
  Holden, has argued, in spite of the Hebrew, that "in the midst of heaven"
  cannot mean mid-day, having made up his mind that the moon can never be
  seen at that hour!</p>

  <p>Such helpers do but make that difficult which, if received in its
  simplicity, need neither perplex a child nor a philosopher.</p>

  copy of the bishop's own description of the MS. (which should be called
  the <i>St. Gall MS.</i>), from the printed Catalogue, which was prepared

  Spliritus, aqua, et sanguis, et tres unum sunt. Sicut in c&oelig;lo tres
  sunt, Pater, Verbum, et Spiritus, et tres unum sunt.' This most important
  word <i>Sicut</i> clearly shows how the disputed passage, from having
  been a Gloss crept into the text. And on the first page prior to the
  Seven Catholic Epistles is the Prologue of St. Jerome, bearing his name
  in uncials, which Porson and other learned men think spurious. See

  <p><i>Harrison's Chronology</i> (Vol. iii., p. 105.).&mdash;To the
  querist on William Harrison all lovers of bibliography are under
  obligations. At Oxford, amid the Bodleian treasures, he could not have
  had many questions to ask: at Thurles the case may be much otherwise, and
  he is entitled to a prompt reply.</p>

  <p>After examining the <i>Typographical Antiquities</i> of Ames and
  Herbert, and various bibliographical works, relying also on my own memory
  as a collector of books for more than thirty years, I may venture to
  assert that the <i>Chronology</i> of W. Harrison has never been printed.
  I can further assert that no copy of the work is recorded in the
  <i>Catalogi librorum manuscriptorum Angli√¶ et Hiberni√¶</i>, Oxoni√¶,
  1697.</p>

  <p>The best account of Harrison is given by bishop Tanner, in his
  <i>Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica</i>. Wood, however, should be
  consulted. With reference to the events of his life, it is important to
  observe that the date of his letter to sir William Brooke, which may be
  called an autobiography in miniature, is 1577.</p>

  <p>Assuming that this question could not escape the notice of other
  contributors, I had made no researches with a view to answer it, and
  shall be happy to remedy the defects of this scrap at a future time.</p>

  am, however, rather surprised to observe, that he seems to take for
  granted the relationship of Julius C√¶sar Scaliger and his son Joseph to
  the Lords of Verona, which has been so convincingly disproved by several
  writers. The world has been for some time pretty well satisfied that
  these two illustrious scholars were mere impostors in the claim they
  made, that Joseph Scaliger's letter to Janus Dousa was a very impudent
  affair. If your correspondent has met with any new evidence in support of
  their claim, it would gratify me much if he would make it known. Who
  would not derive pleasure from seeing the magnificent boast of Joseph
  proved at last to have been founded in fact:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>deprived of its force and stringency? I fear, however, that this is
  not to be expected.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to read Joseph Scaliger's defence of his own case in
  the rejoinder to Scioppius, <i>Confutatio fabul√¶ Burdonum</i>, without
  observing that the author utterly fails in connecting Niccolo, the
  great-grandfather of Joseph, with Guglielmo della Scala, the son of Can
  Grande Secundo. And yet such is the charm of genius, that the
  <i>Confutatio</i>, altogether defective in the main point as a reply,
  will ever be read with delight by succeeding generations of scholars.</p>

  <p><i>By and bye</i> (Vol. iii., p. 73.).&mdash;Your correspondent S. S.,
  in support of his opinion that <i>by the bye</i> means "by the way,"

  commonly received notion, that it is a contraction of "God be wi' ye,"
  appears to me in every way preferable. I think that in the writers of the
  Elizabethan age, every intermediate variety of form (such as "God b' w'
  ye," &amp;c.) may be found; but I cannot at this moment lay my hand on
  any instance.</p>

  <p>In an ingenious and amusing article in a late Number of the
  <i>Quarterly</i>, the character of different nations is shown to be
  indicated by their different forms of greeting, and surely the same may
  be said of their forms of taking leave. The English pride themselves, and
  with justice, on being a peculiarly religious people: now, applying the
  above test,&mdash;as the Frenchman has his <i>adieu</i>, the Italian his
  <i>addio</i>, the Portuguese his <i>addios</i>, and the Spaniard his
  "vaya usted con <i>Dios</i>,"&mdash;it is to be presumed <!-- Page 194
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>that the
  Englishman, also, on parting from his friend, will commit him to the care
  of Providence. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the Germans,
  who, as well as the English, are supposed to entertain a deeper sense of
  religion than many other nations, content themselves with a mere
  "lebe-wohl." I should be obliged if some one of your readers will favour
  me with the forms of taking leave used by other nations, in order that I
  may be enabled to see whether the above test will hold good on a more
  extensive application.</p>

  traced back to one of the typical garments worn by the Jewish high
  priest, which was (see Godwyn's <i>Moses and Aaron</i>, London, 1631,
  lib. i. chap. 5.) "A robe all of blew, with seventy two bels of gold, and
  as many pomegranates, of blew, purple, and scarlet, upon the skirts
  thereof." He says that "by the bells was typed the sound of his
  (Christ's) doctrine; by the pomegranates the sweet savour of an holy
  life;" and, without doubt, by "the blew robe" was typified the
  immutability and truthfulness of the person, mission, and doctrine of our
  great High Priest, who was clothed with truth as with a garment. The
  great Antitype was a literal embodiment of the symbolic panoply of his
  lesser type.</p>

  <p><i>Drachmarus</i> (Vol. iii., p. 157.).&mdash;Your correspondent has
  my most cordial thanks both for his suggestion, and also for his
  conjecture.</p>

  <p>1. Perhaps you will kindly afford me space to say, that the name of
  Drachmarus occurs in a well-written MS. account of Bishop Cosin's
  controversy, during his residence in Paris, with the Benedictine Prior
  Robinson, concerning the validity of our English ordination: in the
  course of which, after stating the opinion of divers of the Fathers, that
  the keys of order and jurisdiction were given John xx., "Quorum peccata,"
  &amp;c., Cosin adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I omit Hugo Cardinalis, the ordinary gloss, <i>Drachmarus</i>,
  Scotus, as men of a later age (though all, as you say, of your church)
  that might be produced to the same purpose."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I should here perhaps state, that no letter of Prior Robinson's is
  extant in which any mention is made either of Drachmarus or of
  Druthmarus.</p>

  <p>2. Before my Query was inserted, it had not only occurred to me as
  probable that the transcriber might have written Drachmarus in mistake
  for Druthmarus, but I had also consulted such of Druthmar's writings as
  are found in the <i>Bibl. Patr.</i> I came to the conclusion, however,
  that a later writer than Christian Druthmar was intended. <i>My</i>
  conjecture was, that Drachmarus must be a second name for some known
  writer of the age of the schoolmen, just as <i>Carbajulus</i> may be
  found cited under the name of <i>Loysius</i>, or <i>Loisius</i>, which
  are only other forms of his Christian name, <i>Ludovicus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The Brownes of Cowdray, Sussex.</i>&mdash;E. H. Y. (Vol. iii., p.
  66.) is wrong in assigning the title of Lord <i>Mountacute</i> to the
  Brownes of Cowdray, Sussex. In 1 &amp; 2 Phil. and Mary, Sir Antony
  Browne (son of the Master of the Horse to Henry VIII.) was created
  Viscount <i>Montague</i> (Collins). When curate of Eastbourne, in which
  parish are situated the ruins of their ancestral Hall of Cowdray, I
  frequently heard the village dames recite the tales of the rude
  forefathers of the hamlet respecting the family.</p>

  <p>They relate, that while the great Sir Antony (temp. Hen. VIII.) was
  holding a revel, a monk presented himself before the guests and
  pronounced the curse of fire and water against the male descendants of
  the family, till none should be left, because the knight had received and
  was retaining the church-lands of Battle Abbey, and those which belonged
  to the priory of Eastbourne. Within the last hundred years, destiny,
  though slow of foot, has overtaken the fated race. In one day the hall
  perished by fire, and the lord by water, as mentioned by E.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Y. The
  male line being extinct, the estate passed to the sister of Lord
  Montague. This lady was married to the late W.&nbsp;S. Poyntz, Esq., M.P. The
  two sons of Mr. and Mrs. Poyntz were drowned at Bognor, and the estate a
  second time devolved on the female representatives. These ladies, still
  living, are the Marchioness of Exeter, the Countess Spencer, and the
  Dowager Lady Clinton. The estate passed by purchase into the hands of the
  Earl of Egmont.</p>

  <p>The old villagers, the servants, and the descendants of servants of
  the family, point to the ruins of the hall, and religiously cling to the
  belief that its destruction and that of its lords resulted from the
  curse. It certainly seems an illustration of Archbishop Whitgift's words
  to Queen Elizabeth:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Church-land added to an ancient inheritance hath proved like a moth
  fretting a garment, and secretly consumed both: or like the eagle that
  stole a coal from the altar, and thereby set her nest on fire, which
  consumed both her young eagles and herself that stole it."</p>

  the Gresley family, I was shown the marble table on which Sir Roger or
  Sir Nigel Gresley had cut up, in a sort of Greenacre style, his cook; for
  which he was obliged to have the bloody hand in his arms, and put into
  the church on his tomb.</p>

  Works</i> published by Talboys in 20 vols. 12mo. in 1840. They are both
  indisputably by Defoe, and contain, as your correspondent observes, many
  anticipations of modern improvements. I may mention that there is a
  tract, also beyond doubt by Defoe, on the subject of London
  street-robberies, which has never yet been noticed or attributed to him
  by any one. It is far more curious and valuable than <i>Second Thoughts
  are best</i>, and is perfectly distinct from that tract. It gives a
  history, and the only one I ever yet met with, written in all Defoe's
  graphic manner, of the London police and the various modes of street
  robbery in the metropolis, from the time of Charles II. to 1731, and
  concludes by suggestions of effectual means of prevention. It is
  evidently the work of one who had lived in London during the whole of the
  period. The title is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An effectual Scheme for the immediate preventing of Street Robberies,
  and suppressing all other Disorders of the Night, with a brief History of

  <p>I have also another tract on the same subject, which has not been
  noticed by Defoe's biographers, but which I have no hesitation in
  ascribing to him. It is curious enough, but not of equal value with the
  last. The title is&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Meaning of Waste-book</i> (Vol. iii., p. 118.).&mdash;The
  <i>waste-book</i> in a counting-house is that in which all the
  transactions of the day, receipts, payments, &amp;c., are entered
  miscellaneously as they occur, and of which no account is immediately
  taken, no value immediately found; whence, so to speak, the mass of
  affairs is undigested, and the wilderness or <i>waste</i> is
  uncultivated, and without result until entries are methodically made in
  the day-book and ledger; without which latter appliances there would, in
  book-keeping, be <i>waste</i> indeed, in the worst sense of the term. The
  word <i>day-book</i> explains itself. The word <i>ledger</i> is explained
  in Johnson's and in Ash's <i>Dictionary</i>, from the Dutch, as
  signifying a book that lies in the counting-house <i>permanently in one
  place</i>. The etymology there given also explains why certain lines used
  in fishing-tackle, by old Isaak Walton, and by his disciples at the
  present day, are called <i>ledger-lines</i>. It, however, does not seem
  to explain the phrase <i>ledger-lines</i>, used in music; namely, the
  term applied to those short lines added above or below the staff of five
  lines, when the notes run very high or very low, and which are exactly
  those which are not <i>permanent</i>. Here the French word <i>l√©ger</i>
  tempts the etymologist a little.</p>

  <p><i>Deus Justificatus</i> (Vol. ii., p. 441.).&mdash;There is no doubt
  that this work was written by Henry Hallywell, and not by Cudworth. Dr.
  Worthington, whose intercourse with the latter was of the most intimate
  kind, and who would have been fully aware of the fact had he been the
  author, observes, in a letter not dated, but written circ. September,
  1668, addressed to Dr. More, and of which I have a copy now before
  me:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I bought at London Mr. Hallywell's <i>Deus Justificatus</i>. Methinks
  it is better written than his former Letter. He will write better and
  better."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a short account of Hallywell, who was of the school of Cudworth and
  More, and whose MS. correspondence with the latter is now in my
  possession, in Wood's <i>Fasti</i>, vol. ii. p. 187. Edit. Bliss, Wood,
  "amongst several things that he hath published," enumerates five only,
  but does not give the <i>Deus Justificatus</i> amongst them. It <!-- Page
  196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span>appears
  (Wood's <i>Athen√¶</i>, vol. iv. p. 230.) that he was ignorant who the
  author of this tract was.</p>

  <p>It is somewhat singular that the mistake in ascribing <i>Deus
  Justificatus</i> to Cudworth should have been continued in Kippis's
  edition of the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>. It was so ascribed to him,
  first, as far as I can find, by a writer of the name of Fancourt, in the
  preface to his <i>Free Agency of Accountable Creatures Examined</i>,
  London, 1733, 8vo. On his authority it was included in the list of
  Cudworth's works in the <i>General Dictionary</i>, 1736, folio, vol. iv.
  p. 487., and in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, 1750, vol. iii. p.
  1581., and in the last edition by Kippis. Birch, in the mean time,
  finding, no doubt, on inquiry, that there was no ground for ascribing it
  to Cudworth, made no mention of it in his accurate life prefixed to the
  edition of the <i>Intellectual System</i> in 1742.</p>

  <p>Hallywell, the author, deserves to be better known. In many passages
  in his works he gives ample proof that he had fully imbibed the lofty
  Platonism and true Christian spirit of his great master.</p>

  valuable communication on these old-fashioned chronometers. The subjoined
  extract from <i>Travels in America in the Year</i> 1806, by Thomas Ashe,

  articles of barter in America at the commencement of the present
  century:&mdash;</p>

  <i>Pocket Sun-dials</i> in "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>,"
  pp. 52. 107. because it re-furnished an opportunity of placing in print a
  scrap of information on the subject, which I neglected to embrace when I
  first read <span class="sc">Mr. Knight's</span> note on the passage in
  Shakspeare. About seventy years ago these small, cheap, brass
  "Ring-dials" for the pocket were manufactured by the gross by a firm in
  Sheffield (Messrs. Proctor), then in Milk street. I well remember the
  workman&mdash;an old man in my boyhood&mdash;who had been employed in
  making them, as he said, "in basketsful;" and also his description of the
  <i>modus operandi</i>, which was curious enough. They were of different
  sizes and prices, and their extreme rarity at present, considering the
  number formerly in use, is only less surprising than the commonness of
  pocket-watches which have superseded them. I never saw but one of these
  cheapest and most nearly forgotten horologia, and which the old
  brass-turner, as I recollect, boasted of as "telling the time true to a
  quarter of an hour!"</p>

  <p><i>Cockade</i> (Vol. iii., p. 7.).&mdash;The Query of A. E. has not
  yet been satisfactorily answered; nor can I pretend to satisfy him. But
  as a small contribution to the history of the decoration in question, I
  beg to offer him the following definition from the <i>Dictionnaire
  √©tymologique</i> of Roquefort, 8vo., Paris, 1829:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Cocarde</span>, touffe de rubans que sous Louis
  XIII. on portoit sur le feutre, et qui imitoit la cr√™te du coq."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If this be correct, <span class="sc">Apodliktes</span> (p. 42.) must
  be mistaken in attributing so recent an origin to the cockade as the date
  of the Hanoverian succession. The truth is, that from the earliest period
  of heraldic institutions, colours have been used to symbolise parties.
  The mode of wearing them may have varied; and whether wrought in silk, or
  more economically represented in the stamped leather cockade of our
  private soldier, is little to the purpose. It will, however, hardly be
  contended that our present fashion at all resembles "la cr√™te du
  coq."</p>

  <p class="author">F. S. Q.

  <p>"The ribband worn in the hat" was styled "a favour" previous to the
  Scotch Covenanters' nick-naming it a cockade. Allow me to correct <span
  class="sc">Apodliktes</span> (p. 42.): "The black <i>favour</i> being the
  Hanoverian badge, the white <i>favour</i> that of the Stuarts." The knots
  or bunches of ribbons given as favours at marriages, &amp;c., were not
  invariably worn in the hat as a cockade is, but it was sometimes (see
  Hudibras, Pt. i. canto ii. line 524.)</p>

  <p><i>Scandal against Queen Elizabeth</i> (Vol. iii., p. 11.).&mdash;It
  is a tradition in a family with which I am connected, that Queen
  Elizabeth had a son, who was sent over to Ireland, and placed under the
  care of the Earl of Ormonde. The Earl, it will be remembered, was
  distantly related to the Queen, her great-grandmother being the daughter
  of Thomas, the eighth Earl.</p>

  <p><i>Private Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth.</i>&mdash;The curious little
  volume mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr. Roper</span> (Vol. iii., p.

  a copy of much later date (1767). It is worthy of note, that the
  narrative is headed <i>The Earl of Essex; or, the Amours of Queen
  Elizabeth</i>; while the title-page states, <i>The secret History of the
  most Renown'd Q. Elizabeth and Earl of Essex</i>.</p>

  <p>I think it can scarcely be said to be <i>corroborative</i> of the
  "scandal" contained in Mr. Ives's MS. note, or that in Burton's
  <i>Parliamentary Diary</i>, cited by P.&nbsp;T., Vol. ii. p. 393. Whitaker, in
  his <i>Vindication of Mary Q. of Scots</i>, has displayed immense
  industry and research in his collection of charges against the private
  life of Elizabeth, but makes no mention of these reports.</p>

  <p><i>Bibliographical Queries</i> (No. 39.), <i>Monarchia Solipsorum</i>
  (Vol. iii., p. 138.).&mdash;Your correspondent asks, Can there be the
  smallest doubt that the veritable inventor of this satire upon the
  Jesuits was their former associate, Jules-Clement Scotti? Having paid
  considerable attention to the writings of Scotti, Inchofer, and
  Scioppius, and to the evidence as to the authorship of this work, I
  should, notwithstanding Niceron's authority, on which your correspondent
  seems to rely, venture to assert that the claim made for Scotti, as well
  as that for Scioppius, may be at once put aside. No two authors ever more
  carefully protected their literary offspring, numerous as they were, by
  the catalogues and lists of them which they published or dispersed from
  time to time, than these two writers. In them every tract is claimed,
  however short, which they had written. Scotti published one in 1650, five
  years after the publication of the <i>Monarchia Solipsorum</i>; and I
  have a letter of his, of the same period, containing a list of his
  writings. Scioppius left one, dated 1647, now in MS. in the Laurentian
  Library with his other MSS., and which carefully mentions every tract he
  had written against the Jesuits. The <i>Monarchia Solipsorum</i> does not
  appear in the lists of these two writers; and no good reason can be
  assigned why it should not, on the supposition of its being written by
  either of them. If not in those which were published, it certainly would
  not have been omitted in those communicated to their friends, not
  Jesuits, or which were found amongst their own MSS. Then, nothing can be
  more distinct than the style of Scotti, of Scioppius, and that of the
  author, whoever he was, of the <i>Monarchia</i>. The much-vexed spirit of
  the bitterest of critics would have been still more indignant if one or
  two of the passages in this work could ever, in his contemplation, have
  been imputed to his pen.</p>

  <p>It is in this case, as in most other similar ones, much easier to
  conclude who is not, than who is the author of the book in question. The
  internal evidence is very strong in favour of Inchofer. It was published
  with his name in 1652, seven years only after the date of the first
  edition; and the witnesses are many among his contemporaries, who speak
  positively to his being the author. Further, there is no great
  dissimilarity in point of style, and I have collected several parallel
  expressions occurring in the <i>Monarchia</i> and Inchofer's other works,
  which very much strengthen the claim made on his behalf, but which it is
  scarcely necessary to insert here. In my opinion, he is the real author.
  The question might, I have no doubt, be finally set at rest by an
  examination of his correspondence with Leo Allatius, which is, or was, at
  all events, in the Vatican.</p>

  Glasshouse Yard, Aldersgate, aged 102 years, was a soldier in the reign
  of William and Mary, and the person who was tried and condemned by a
  Court Martial for falling asleep on his duty upon the terrace at Windsor.
  He absolutely denied the charge against him, and solemnly declared that
  he heard St. Paul's clock strike thirteen, the truth of which was much
  doubted by the court because of the great distance. But whilst he was
  under sentence of death, an affidavit was made by several persons that
  the clock actually did strike thirteen instead of twelve; whereupon he
  received his majesty's pardon. The above his friends caused to be
  engraved upon his plate, to satisfy the world of the truth of a story
  which has been much doubted, though he had often confirmed it to many
  gentlemen, and a few days before his death told it to several of his
  neighbours. He enjoyed his sight and memory to the day of his

  time. Authority of convocation, or of Parliament, such as our Liturgy
  had, never had they any: only the Queen, by her Letters Patent to the
  Stationers, gave leave to have them printed, and allowed them (did not
  command them) to be sung in churches or private houses by the people.
  When the Liturgy was set forth, and commanded to be used, these psalms
  were not half of them composed: no bishop ever inquired of their
  observance, nor did ever any judge at an assize deliver them in his
  charge: which both the one and other had been bound to do, if they had
  been set forth by the same authority which the Liturgy was. Besides you
  may observe, that they are never printed with the Liturgy or Bible, nor
  ever were; but only bound up, as the stationers please, together with
  it," &amp;c.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The last number of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> contains a very
  important paper upon the limited accessibility of the State Paper Office
  to literary inquirers, and the consequent injury to historical
  literature. But not only is the present system illiberal; it seems that
  it has been determined by the Lords of the Treasury that the historical
  papers anterior to 1714 shall be transferred from the State Paper Office
  to the new Record Office, which is now rising rapidly on the Rolls
  Estate. Under present circumstances, this is a transfer from bad to
  worse. Our contemporary shows the absurdity and injustice to literature
  of such a determination in a very striking manner. We cannot follow him
  through his proofs, but are bound as the organ of literary men to direct
  attention to the subject. It is most important to every one who is
  interested&mdash;and who is not?&mdash;in the welfare of historical
  literature. <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The <i>Unpublished Manuscripts on Church Government</i> by Archbishop
  Laud, stated to have been prepared for the education of Prince Henry, and
  subsequently presented to Charles I., which we mentioned in our
  sixty-ninth number, was sold by Messrs. Puttick and Simpson, on the 24th
  ultimo, for Twenty Guineas. And here we may note that in the Collection
  of Autographs sold by the same auctioneers on Friday last, among other
  valuable articles was a Letter of Burke, dated 3rd Oct. 1793, from which
  we quote the following passage, which will be read with interest at the
  present time, and furnishes some information respecting Cardinal
  Erskine&mdash;the subject of a recent Query:&mdash;"I confess, I would,
  if the matter rested with me, enter into much more distinct and avowed
  political connections with the Court of Rome than hitherto we have held.
  If we decline them, the bigotry will be on our part and not on that of
  his Holiness. Some mischief has happened, and much good has, I am
  convinced, been prevented by our unnatural alienation.</p>

  <p>... With regard to Monsignor Erskine, I am certain that all his
  designs are formed upon the most honourable and the most benevolent
  public principles." One of the most interesting lots at the sale was a
  proclamation of the "Old Pretender," dated Rome, 23 Dec. 1743, given
  "under our Sign Manual and Privy Seal," the seal having the inscription
  "<span class="sc">Jacobus III. Rex</span>," which fetched Eleven
  Pounds.</p>

  <p>We believe there are few libraries in this country, however small, in
  which there is not to be found one shelf devoted to such pet books on
  Natural History as White's <i>Selborne</i>, the <i>Journal of a
  Naturalist</i>, and Waterton's <i>Wanderings</i>. The writings of Mr.
  Knox are obviously destined to take their place in the same honoured
  spot. Actuated with the same love of nature, and gifted with the same
  power of patient observation as White, he differs from him in the wider
  range over which he extends his observation, and in combining the ardour
  of the sportsman with the scientific spirit of inquiry which
  distinguishes the naturalist. In his <i>Game Birds and Wild Fowl: their
  Friends and their Foes</i>, which contains the result of his observations
  and experience, not only on the birds described in his title-page, but on
  certain other animals supposed, oftentimes most erroneously, to be
  injurious to their welfare and increase&mdash;we have a work which
  reflects the highest credit upon the writer, and can scarcely fail to
  accomplish the great end for which Mr Knox wrote it, that of "adding new
  votaries to a loving observation of nature."</p>

  <p>Each Period, except the First, is illustrated by portions of the
  Interior and the Exterior of one of our Cathedral Churches of
  corresponding date, beautifully engraved on Steel, so presented as to
  enable the Student to draw for himself a close comparison of the
  characteristic features which distinguish the Architecture of each of the
  <span class="sc">Seven Periods</span>, and which are of so striking and
  simple a nature as to prevent the possibility of mistake.</p>

  <p>The First, or Saxon Period, contains so few buildings of interest or

<p class="cenhead"><i>Testimonial of Augustus de Morgan, Esq.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have examined the proofs of Mr. Filipowski's Table of
  Anti-Logarithms and of Gauss's Logarithms, and also the plan of his
  proposed table of Annuities for three lives, constructed from the
  Carlisle Table.</p>

  <p>"The table of Anti-Logarithms is, I think, all that could be wished,
  in extent, in structure, and in typography. For its extent it is unique
  among modern Tables. Of accuracy I cannot speak, of course; but this
  being supposed, I have no hesitation in recommending it without
  qualification.</p>

  <p>"The form in which Gauss's Tables are arranged will be a matter of
  opinion. I can only say that Mr. Filipowski's Table is used with ease, as
  I have found upon trial; and that its extent, as compared with other
  tables, and particularly with other <span class="scac">FIVE-FIGURE</span>
  tables, of the same kind, will recommend it. I desire to confine myself
  to testifying to the facility with which this table can be used:
  comparison with other forms, as to <span class="scac">RELATIVE</span>
  facility, being out of the question on so short a trial.</p>

  <p>"On the table of Annuities for three lives, there is hardly occasion
  to say anything. All who are conversant with Life Contingencies are well
  aware how much it is wanted. <span class="sc">A. de Morgan</span>."</p>
